# Class ---------------------->
"""
==>  Class Acts as an blueprint
==>  Class Represents properties(attributes) and actions (behaviour) of an object
"""

# Object --------------------->
"""
==>  A physical existance of a class is nothing but object
==>  An instance of a class is nothing but object.
==>  We can create any number of objects for a class 
"""

# What is REFERENCE VARIABLE -------------->
"""
==> The variable which can be used to refer object is called reference variable 
==> By using reference variable,we can perform required operations on the object
==> By using reference variable we can access properties and methods of an object 
==> An object can have multiple reference variables
"""
# STATIC Variables ------------------------>
"""
==> If the value of a variable  is not varied from  object to object,then it is not recommended 
    to declare those variables as an instance variables.We have to declareat class level as static variables
==> In the case of instance variables for every object a seperate copy will be created.But in th case of static 
    variables at class only one copy will be created and shared by every object of that class.
==> Most of the times, static variables should be declared within the class directly.
