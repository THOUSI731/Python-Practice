# Features of Python: =============================================================>
"""
1. Simple and easy to learn
2. Freeware and Open Source
3. High Level Programming language
4. Platform Independent : -  PVM is responsible to convert into machine understandable form.
5. Portability
6. Dynamically Typed
7. Both Procedure Oriented and Object Oriented
8. Interpreted
9. Extensible
10. Embedded
11. Extensive Library

# Flavors of Python: ============================================================>
"""
1.CPython:
     It is the standard flavor of Python. It can be used to work with C lanugage Applications
     
2. Jython or JPython:
     It is for Java Applications. It can run on JVM
     
3. IronPython:
     It is for C#.Net platform
     
4.PyPy:
     The main advantage of PyPy is performance will be improved because JIT compiler is 
     available inside PVM.
     
5.RubyPython
     For Ruby Platforms
     
6. AnacondaPython
     It is specially designed for handling large volume of data processing
"""

# Identifiers ===============================================================================>
"""
A name in Python program is called identifier.
It can be class name or function name or module name or variable name

Note:
1. If identifier starts with _ symbol then it indicates that it is private
2. If identifier starts with __(two under score symbols) indicating that strongly private 
identifier.
3.If the identifier starts and ends with two underscore symbols then the identifier is 
language defined special name,which is also known as magic methods.
"""

# Reserved Words: ===========================================================================>
"""
In Python some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality. Such type 
of words are called Reserved words

There are 33 reserved words available in Python.
                True,False,None
                and, or ,not,is
                if,elif,else
